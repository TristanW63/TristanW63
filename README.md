Hi, I'm Tristan Wilson and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Nashville, TN. I recently graduated from Vanderbilt University's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp and I'm eager to bring my skills and passion for web development to a creative and problem-solving team.
I have a strong foundation in various technologies, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL, MySQL, Express, React, Node, Bootstrap, NoSQL, Git, MongoDB, and GraphQL. Throughout my studies and projects, I have developed a solid understanding of how to build dynamic and scalable web applications.
